welcome back to our weekly assassin's

creed lore overview

right here at psg every week on probably

about tuesday

we pick one of the assassin's creed

games and we give you a synopsis of the

plot behind it

and today we're going to be covering

assassin's creed brotherhood

click the links down below to see how we

got here after escaping the templars

desmond once again plugs into the animus

as lucy and her team head for the last

safe house

inside the memories of ezio auditory

desmond watches as his ancestor leaves

the vaults where he discovered the

strange being known as a minerva

ezio is confused by what he saw and

surprised to discover that rodrigo has

escaped which honestly i don't know why

he's surprised about he left him alive

aided by his uncle mario ezio and his

friends return once

more to their villa at first ezio is at

peace

believing that his mission of vengeance

has come to an end that rodrigo would in

no way

want any form of revenge the templars

are not done with them yet

as the rest of us it led by cesare

borgia

the templar forces attack the city the

villa is destroyed and ezio is wounded

and after he obtains the apple of eden

cesare then kills mario as ezio is

watching

though he is wounded ezio manages to

chase after cesare but quickly passes

out from his wounds after these events

play out

desmond awakens from the animus and his

team has arrived at the remains of

ezio's villa

where they hope to hide from abstergo

within an assassin's sanctuary beneath

the philip

slipping inside with his new abilities

that he has learned from the bleed

effect

which is when you've been in the animus

too long and you learn how to be that

individual

desmond quickly unlocks the sanctuary

for others reestablishing the power

sources there

within the sanctuary desmond sees images

of ezio and strange

writings on the wall and once inside

lucy explains that they need to find the

apple of eden in the hopes that they can

stop whatever event minerva tried to

warn them about

after setting up the new animus desmond

once again descends into his ancestors

memories he awakens

back in rome with ezio quickly meeting

nicolo machiavelli an old friend and

fellow assassin

seo is shocked to discover that the

assassins have been losing in their war

against the templars

and their corruption vowing vengeance

for his uncle mario and hoping to once

again acquire the apple of eden

ezio sets out to free roam from the

templars influence

it takes four years for him to fight

against the templar forces and in this

time

he begins to rebuild the assassin order

recruiting novices

while also re-establishing relations

within the great guilds of the city

with the assassin order once again

strong and united ezio begins to send

teams throughout the country to fight

against templar oppression

for his work he is named the mentor of

the assassins

however cesare learns avezio's work and

the assassins going about rebuilding so

he goes to his father rodrigo the pope

in the hopes of more money more men and

the power of the apple

but the pope doesn't wish to provoke the

assassin order informing jesus that he

should not have attacked them

that he should have left them alone and

that he knew that this would eventually

happen

but he also knows that his son won't

stop in his pursuits

the cesare feels slighted by their

assassins and insists on proving that

the borgias are more powerful than the

assassins

so rodrigo the pope attempts to poison

his son

but jesuit knows of his father's plot

and kills him instead

what cesare doesn't know is that ezio

actually snuck inside of the castle and

saw him murder rodrigo

cesare learns of the apple's location

and he sets out with ezio in pursuit

and luckily the assassin manages to get

to the apple first

using the artifacts of vast power ezio

manages to break up cesare's army

then aided by his fellow assassins he

fights against jesuit at the gates of

rome the fight is interrupted though

when the armies of the new pope arrive

and arrest him for the murder of

rodrigo as he's led away cheshire tells

ezio that he won't be in chains long

these words worried ezio and he used the

apple to look into the future

he saw that cesare was right that he

would not remain imprisoned

so ezio sets off on his own believing

that his brotherhood would survive

without

him in 1507 when ezio finally caught up

to cesare

fighting through the siege of vienna to

face the man ezio faced

cesare in the final fight on the castle

walls but even in defeat

cesare claimed that he would not die by

the hands of man

ezio agreed allowing jesus death to be

at the hands of fate

and with these words he threw him off

the castle wall

shockingly the fall did manage to kill

him so in a way

he wasn't wrong about his death and with

his mission finally finished ezio once

again returns to the city of rome

where he hides the apple within a vault

beneath the santa maria artichole

coming out of the animus the team

quickly figures out that the strange

writings on the wall of the sanctuary

are the spoken password that they will

need to get inside of that vault

heading to rome desmond quickly slips

inside where he discovers

another hologram of the first

civilization individual

juno as juno begins to speak to him

desmond discovers that only he can hear

and see her and as he continues into the

temple of juno the holograms explained

that mankind

was not created to be wise that they

lack the sense of knowledge and that the

first

civilization should have left them the

way that they were

finally with the others in the chamber

they discovered the apple of eden on a

raised

platform and after he worked out how to

get to the apple desmond reaches out

and he touches it suddenly time stops

all around him and before him stands

juno who explains that desmond is

actually descended from her race

and that he is her enemy she explains

that there is a woman who must not be

allowed to accompany him through the

gate

these words make little sense to desmond

but it doesn't matter as time begins to

flow again

desmond finds that juno has taken

control of his body

she forces him across the room and uses

his hidden blade to stab

lucy in the stomach both fall to the

ground the desmond

slipping into a coma as lucy bleeds out

before him

and that is the storyline to brotherhood

now for those who are wondering

our plan with these assassin's creed

lore videos is to begin by doing each

and every one of the games telling you

how they all link together

then we're going to do a master timeline

in which i explain everything that

happened in the modern day

and what's going on in the past on top

of that we're also going to be telling

you story lines that are happening in

the

mobile games in the comic books and

stuff like that

so we're hoping that by the time we get

done with this coverage of assassin's

creed here at psg

you will know everything that there is

to know about assassin's creed

and if you're curious me benny on the

psg podcast i'm telling you about my

journey

i'm trying to platinum every single

assassin's creed game and oh my god is

it getting annoying at times

either way guys thank you so much for

watching this video and please come back

next tuesday for the next chapter of our

assassin's creed lore

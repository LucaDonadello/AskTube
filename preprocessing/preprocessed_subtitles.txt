another intervention by paolo maldini the ball goes out and there is the referee collina who decides to intervene with the yellow card precisely for helveg who knows he did it in fact he apologizes we were saying stadium that is about to be handed over to uefa because in the free kick in favor of the rossoneri ball put in the area the header giori who had had many problems that had recovered only

moments before inters chance with a particular episode in front of sebar rossi on the reversal of front serginho still free to roam there on the left it is clear that zanetti is not a marker overall matches at home interista nice ball dien for comandini and here there is the touch from behind by simic the intervention of the referee collina with the yellow in his hands leeste nere wanted the red the milan players pushed away there is the intervention of costa curta for gattuso the cross the header milan still alive in the opponents penalty area the teammates the ball is now worked by bovieri

before the end of the first half with comandini great ball by milan frei made a great one at the end of the first half recovers the ball the nerazzurri formation with the referee collina who sends everyone to the locker rooms first half ended in the derby of 11 may 2001 shot from above 20 in favour of milan thanks to the goals by comandini the brace on an assist inter entered the field clarence seedorf makes a certain effect of entered the field in the clar zed however towards the right where there is ferrari ferrari sees zanetti in space zanetti arrives in the area the ball deflected by br junior inter tried with this move by marco tardelli a would have passed in the meantime watch out for recoba who tries to put it in the middle and there is the chius to milan and unit daav from milan to inter seedorf makes a bad foul from behind on andreev a rather moving tackle in the nerazzurri penalty area giuns ball bounces the goal 30 in the eighth minute of the second half frey cant believe it frey cant take it anymore federico thas elvec goes with him and rino gattuso also pulls his teammate 30 in favor of milan milan had scored the first goal of the first half after 3 minutes with comandini and scored the first goal of the second half after 8 minutes with federico giunti third rossoneri goal in the derby of may 11th he favors one of the two teams here in a sensational way he favors at milan bobovs shot vieri pal marco tardelli a bottle rains down on the pitch recovas corner the header the ball goes out here inter dangerous for gresco these shots right from above were the techniques he doesnt insert birov who had probably already pulled the plug on this derby and maybe he wasnt very well meanwhile first great attack by serginho from the right serginho ends up on the ground he wanted something but the referee cina applies the same yardstick he had applied in the first half on this type of by recoba goes in pursuit of the ball cesare maldini then zanetti the ball comes out cesare maldini on the bench here paolo maldini asked for more cover from his teammates maybe opposite defensive line nerazzurri from the first minute here now he goes to the cross header and ball seedorf beat actually no he doesnt beat the ball but it ends up out he kicked recoba at the end zor mar opens up for serginho milan who returns to attack with inter unbalanced serginho serginho here serginho they dont get him anymore goes to the cross serginho ball put in the middle chef 40 for milan fourth goal for milan in the 22nd minute of the second half milan who rages milan who goes on the counterattack inter punished by the rossoneri go but also by the incidents in any case when the score says inter 0 milan 4 and its played at home tef of the inter fans enough says a rossoneri fan of the curve enough like this instead there is there is still to play there is still aggio there is still space available adso the north curve still seedorf who tries to restart seedorf passes to recoba who however goes too wide the cross shot well done seba sebas deflection in the corner recoba wanted to give himself a satisfaction he wanted to give a signal also a partial satisfaction to his fans costacurta jumped and then there is the open hand of sebar rossi who deflects it into the corner here too costacurta came out in a timely manner there was an offside there was a flag raised by the director of in the world final that he tries to pass the ball forward calazze calazze resists the charge calazze takes flight arrives on the left calazze and it is still a goal for milan the fifth on the axis calazze sevcenko double also for sheva as for comandini 50 milan milan is a constant this derby at a certain point the ball seems to be dragging along in midfield it seems all stopped in midfield at a certain point milan starts finding no resistance between the nerazzurri defensive lines and goes to put balls in the middle just to push into the net serginho pereva did it before calaz

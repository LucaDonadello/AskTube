effect of entered the field in the clar

Zed However towards the right where there is Ferrari

Ferrari sees Zanetti in space Zanetti

arrives in the area the ball deflected

by br Junior Inter tried with

this move by Marco Tardelli a

would have passed in the meantime watch out for

Recoba who tries to put it in the middle and

teams here in a sensational way he

favors at Milan Bobov's shot

Vieri Pal Marco

Tardelli a bottle rains down on the pitch

Recova's corner the

header the ball goes out Here Inter

dangerous for Gresco these

shots right from above were the

techniques he doesn't insert Birov who had

probably already pulled the

plug on this derby  and maybe he

wasn't very well Meanwhile first great

attack by

serginho from the right serginho ends up on the

ground he wanted something but the referee Cina

applies the same yardstick he had

applied in the first half on this type of by

recoba goes in

pursuit of the ball Cesare

Maldini then Zanetti the ball

comes out Cesare Maldini on the bench here

Paolo Maldini asked for more cover

from his teammates maybe

opposite defensive line Nerazzurri from the first

minute here now he goes to the cross header

and ball Seedorf

beat Actually no he doesn't beat the ball

but it ends up out he kicked recoba

at the end zor Mar opens up for serginho

Milan who returns to attack with Inter

unbalanced serginho serginho Here

serginho they don't get him anymore goes to the cross

serginho ball put in the middle chef 4-0 for

Milan fourth goal for Milan in the 22nd minute

of the second half Milan who rages

Milan who goes on the counterattack Inter punished

by the Rossoneri Go But also by the incidents

in any case when the score says

Inter 0 Milan 4 and it's played at home

tef of the Inter fans enough says a

Rossoneri fan of the curve enough like this

instead there is there is still to play there is

still Aggio there is still space

available adso the north curve still

Seedorf who tries to restart Seedorf

passes to recoba who however goes

too wide the cross shot Well done Seba

Seba's deflection in the corner

recoba wanted to give himself a

satisfaction he wanted to give a signal

also a partial satisfaction to

his fans Costacurta jumped and then

there is the open hand of sebar Rossi who

deflects it into the corner here too Costacurta came

out in a

timely manner there was an

offside there was a flag raised

by the director of

in the

world final that He tries to pass the ball

forward calazze calazze resists the

charge calazze takes flight arrives on the

left calazze and it is still a goal for

Milan the fifth on the axis calazze

sevcenko double also for Sheva as

for Comandini 5-0 Milan Milan is a

constant this derby at a certain point

the ball seems to be dragging along in

midfield it seems  all stopped in

midfield at a certain point Milan

starts finding no resistance between the

Nerazzurri defensive lines and goes to put

balls in the middle just to push into the net

Serginho Pereva did it before

Calaz Pereva did it now too And yet Blan got

involved but by now Calaz

had broken through and Shevchenko goes to

anticipate in front of Gresco Frey and there

are five goals of difference in the gap

between Inter and Milan that evening evening more

than the opposite ANC Maldini changes with

Calas Here Milan

briefly tries to stop ball from Roque Junior

there is a header Serginho Serginho reads

Sevcenko's movement Serginho

slips in Serginho takes care of the sixth goal

Inter 0 Milan 6 Here comes the

6-0 the worst nightmare for

opposing fans for any team facing

a Derby you see the fan with the

Nerazzurri scarf behind Serginho the

sense and that's it Stop it though

after all it's football it's the pitch  there is the half of the

field that opens up does not celebrate and does not

smile Cesare Maldini is evidently happy in his heart

But he is

also a little sorry for Marco Tardelli a

position a free kick so severe a free

kick so hard so sensational so

unrepeatable in a Derby here

we see Serginho halfway between Zanetti and

Gresco Zanetti had sensed the danger

and the Rossoneri fans let off steam

then Leonardo's touch back

tries with a free kick in favor of

the Inter players who present themselves with

Recoba and Seedorf near the

Rossoneri goal Inter had conceded six goals

that season even in a

Coppa Italia match in Parma it was the duty to

go for every ball to sprint

not to stop because of course the

fans want this but the

Nerazzurri goal does not arrive even in this

circumstance with Recoba's shot followed

with the gaze the referee Collina is about to blow the final whistle

now a match that

no longer has anything to say and it's over and it

's over the arms raised to the sky of Cesare

Maldini who edited

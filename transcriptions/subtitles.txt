so if you're a beginner with credit

cards it can be exciting with all the

possibilities to get sign up bonuses

cash back points and a bunch of other

cool things but the truth is that as a

credit card beginner that's also the

most dangerous time for you because

there's plenty of ways that you can

easily slip up and make some common

mistakes that have some pretty bad

consequences these consequences include

things like getting into high interest

credit card debt big drops in your

credit score and some other general

struggles with money that many people

could have avoided that's why in this

video we're gonna go over the five

credit card lessons that beginners need

to learn because these five key lessons

can help anyone to get the positives out

of credit card usage without any of

those bad things that some of you might

be afraid of so as always let's not

waste any time here and just get right

into it make sure to go ahead and tap

as well to get this video pushed out to

more people but this first lesson that i

want to talk about here is easily the

top thing that many people skip over

even though it's so important and that

lesson is to have an emergency fund in

place when using credit cards now i know

this might sound boring but hear me out

because the reason for having an

emergency fund is simple for the most

part we all have a good idea of what we

expect to spend money on each month when

it comes to expenses like rent groceries

gas and other typical things like that

but there's also many other unexpected

expenses in life that are guaranteed to

pop up that we overlook in our budgets i

know that for me in the past i've had to

randomly pay several hundred dollars to

get new tires for my car or maybe a

couple hundred dollars to take my cat to

the vet just things like that that cost

extra money that i didn't plan to spend

so because of those unexpected expenses

i've made it a priority over the past

few years to build up an emergency fund

of six months worth of estimated

expenses in a savings account that way

i'm prepared if a random expense pops up

i can pay with my credit card to get

points but then i pay off that balance

immediately because i have the

flexibility to do that now unfortunately

that's not what everyone does because

for most people that don't have those

extra cash savings set aside they still

might use a credit card to pay for those

unexpected expenses however they might

only be relying on future cash flows to

pay off that credit card balance now

under normal conditions that might work

if you have a rough estimate of what

your income minus your expenses will be

each month but honestly we all should

know that life isn't always perfect and

things don't usually go according to

plan i mean what if several expenses

start adding up or you have one huge

expense that costs you several thousand

dollars or what if your income goes away

or decreases for some reason when that

happens you'll still be left with a

credit card balance that you have to pay

back pretty soon but with those cash

flow issues that could lead you to make

the mistake of paying only the minimum

payment and carrying a balance which

we'll get into later in this video so my

point that i'm trying to make here with

this first lesson is that life is

unpredictable and the best defense

against that unpredictability is by

having some sort of a cash safety net to

fall back on and if you don't think that

something like this could happen to you

just think about this millions of people

in the u.s collectively owe almost one

trillion dollars in credit card debt

right i guarantee you that a large

percentage of those people in credit

card debt were just like you and me when

they signed up for those first credit

cards where they didn't have the

intention of carrying a balance ever but

still this debt grows and grows because

the biggest problem with credit card

debt isn't the function of how it works

i mean most of us do know that credit

card debt is bad the biggest problem

with credit card debt mostly has to do

with our own behaviors around how we

handle our money and manage risk based

on our own lives and our own experiences

so play it safe and prepare for the

worst because you don't want to ever

have to turn to high interest credit

card debt financing as your only option

to pay for unexpected expenses now next

for lesson number two this is directly

related to what we just talked about but

it's more of a mindset shift for people

and that lesson is to treat your credit

card like a debit card so you may have

heard me or others on youtube say

something like this before but it really

is the right way to think about credit

cards too many times i'll see people get

a new credit card and they'll see that

they have this new credit limit of maybe

five thousand dollars over here so they

say to themselves that's five thousand

dollars of the bank's money that i can

use for whatever and then i'll just

worry about paying it back later but the

mindset shift that i had early on was to

almost forget about that credit limit

for a minute and pretend that whatever

credit card i was holding said debit on

the front instead now normally with an

actual debit card that card is linked to

your bank account so that any time you

swipe it to make a purchase the money is

simply subtracted from your bank account

to pay that means that without

considering overdrafts in order to use a

debit card you actually need to already

have that money in your bank account so

the transaction can go through now with

a credit card we're involving a third

party with the credit card issuer and

like i said a lot of people view this

like they're using someone else's money

with that credit limit but i've never

really looked at it like this i've only

looked at my credit card as basically a

substitute for my debit card by making

sure that i've already got plenty of

cash set aside in my bank account before

i use my credit card for anything and

this goes back to the whole emergency

fund thing i think it's a good idea to

have some money set aside in a savings

account for emergencies along with some

money set aside in a checking account to

pay certain bills and to pay off credit

card balances so because i keep several

thousand dollars in cash in my bank

accounts that i can easily access it

doesn't matter if i have a 100 trip to

the grocery store or i need to make an

800 tire replacement i know that i can

use my credit card to pay for those

things because i can pay off that credit

card balance whenever i want and because

of that i get a few benefits by simply

substituting my debit card for my credit

card as my preferred method of payment

first i earn points or cashback that i

can put towards my travel expenses that

way i travel almost completely for free

i also have increased my credit score

pretty quickly so that now it sits in

the high 700s because i've learned the

importance of payment history and credit

utilization those are two things that

i'm gonna get into in just a minute as

well because in this video those things

are so important for beginners

especially to understand and

additionally i don't pay any interest

from credit cards because i pay off my

cards in full each month which leads me

to lesson number three and that is

actually to ignore the apr and minimum

payment amount on your credit card

statement and just pay off your balances

in full every month now i'm not saying

that your apr is not important because

you should see the number and see that

it's anywhere from 15 to 25 and that apr

should scare you if you do carry a

balance you want the lowest apr possible

but as a beginner we're trying to avoid

ever carrying a balance in the first

place so the reason we actually want to

ignore that apr is because that number

is irrelevant when you pay your credit

card's full statement balance each month

by the payment due date when you pay

your statement balance in full you won't

be charged any interest so the apr

doesn't matter it could be 1 000 for my

credit cards or it could be 15 it

doesn't affect me because over the past

six or seven years of using credit cards

i've paid off every single one of them

on time and info now i have a full video

here on my channel simply explaining the

whole process for how and when to pay

off your credit card bill which i'm

gonna link to down below but here's just

a few things to know first you're going

to have a billing cycle with an opening

date and a closing date and on that

closing date whatever your balance is on

that day is going to be called your

statement balance now along with that

statement balance you're also going to

see a minimum payment due amount and

that is likely going to be significantly

lower than your statement balance you'll

also see a payment due date which is

typically at least 21 days after that

closing date for this statement where

you have to pay at least the minimum

payment but like i said before we want

to ignore that minimum payment amount

because paying the minimum is what the

credit card companies want you to do

that way the remaining unpaid statement

balance can carry over to the next

credit card statement and they can start

charging you interest at those high

interest rates it's a common myth that

carrying a balance helps your credit

score but that's just not true at all we

want to be paying the full statement

balance instead by that payment due date

all right moving on to credit card

lesson number four which is about

another thing that easily gets

overlooked by beginners because they're

not always aware of it and that lesson

is to keep credit utilization low so

payment history and credit utilization

are the two most important factors

affecting your credit score and credit

utilization basically focuses on two

things your credit card balance and your

credit card's credit limit it's

calculated as a percentage for each

individual credit cards as well as

across all cards combined and the

calculation for this is pretty simple to

understand you just take your credit

card's balance and then divide it by

your credit card limit to see how much

of your available credit you're

utilizing as a percentage now this

calculation is typically done on or

right around your statement closing date

each month when your statement balance

gets reported to the credit bureaus so

for example if my credit card statement

closed on may 15th and my balance on

that date was 500 and my credit limit

was 1 000 and my credit utilization

would be reported as 50 which is

actually too high and likely going to

hurt my credit score now a general rule

of thumb is to keep this percentage

below 30 but ideally below 10 and the

lower the percentage the better so for

me i don't end up using every single one

of my active credit cards every month

but for the ones that i do end up using

i try to keep my credit utilization

maybe around one to two percent i'm able

to intentionally manage this and keep

this utilization percentage so low

because like i said that calculation is

done and reported to the credit bureaus

on the statement closing date each month

so i know that if i actually pre-pay

some of my card's balance before then i

can get a lower utilization reported if

we go back to my example if my statement

closing date on my card was may 15th and

i had a 500 balance with that 1 000

limit i would want to prepay so that my

utilization wouldn't be reported as too

high so what i would do is maybe a few

days before that on may 10th i would

prepay an amount that would decrease my

balance so let's say that on may 10th i

pre-paid 490 that would bring my balance

down to just 10 and when may 15th rolls

around just a few days later and my

statement closes that 10 balance would

get reported not 500 so as far as the

credit bureaus know from the information

that they receive on my closing date my

ten dollar statement balance on a one

thousand dollar limit is only a one

percent credit utilization and that

looks like i'm being way more

responsible with the credit that i've

been given now i usually don't get this

exact with pre-paying my credit cards

because now at this stage in my credit

journey my credit limits are much higher

than just 1 000 which gives me a lot

more room to spend without having to

worry that much about what my

utilization is but as a beginner the

challenge is that you usually get

started with a low credit limit whether

that's a limit on a secured or unsecured

card so maybe you only have a secured

credit card as your first card right now

and you had to put down a 250 deposit to

get a 250 credit limit to start off that

doesn't give you much room for spending

a lot when thinking about that card's

credit utilization so the best way to

use a secured card or any card with a

low credit limit in a scenario like this

would be to either use that only for a

small purchase of a few dollars each

month and then pay it off after the

statement closes but before the payment

due date or if you spend maybe a hundred

dollars on something you could make a 95

payment partially pay down that balance

before the statement closing date that

way a much smaller credit utilization

gets reported which looks good for your

credit score early on as a beginner so

with credit utilization just be aware of

how that's calculated what your balance

is what your credit limit is and what

your statement closing date will be

because then you can manage what

utilization gets reported to boost your

credit score all right now finally for

the fifth lesson in this video we're

gonna move over to payment history which

is that other factor of your credit

score that's so important and that

lesson is to never miss a credit card

payment now actually payment history is

slightly more important for your credit

score than credit utilization since

payment history makes up about 35 of

your fico score and utilization makes up

about 30 basically payment history is

important because future lenders looking

at your credit report want to make sure

that you have a strong history of paying

back things that you owe and credit

utilization is important because future

lenders want to make sure that you're

not being too risky and using too much

of the credit that you've been given now

luckily payment history is more

straightforward to understand but

there's still some hidden things to know

that can help you to stay ahead of your

credit cards as a beginner so back to

your credit card statement i explained

earlier in this video that there's going

to be a payment due date that's

typically 21 days after your statement

closing date the simple thing that you

have to do to positively impact your

credit score with payment history is

just remember to pay at least the

minimum payment by the payment due date

for it to be considered on time now

again the minimum payment is the bare

minimum so i do not recommend paying

only that amount you should pay the full

statement balance by that payment due

date to avoid carrying a balance and

paying interest but when you have a

perfect 100 record of on-time payments

that's the best outcome for payment

history on that portion of your credit

score now with each payment that you

actually miss you'll start to see

negative impacts to your score and even

just a couple of late payments can be a

bad thing since those are gonna stay on

your credit report for about seven years

a missed payment is also probably going

to get you hit with a late fee of maybe

30 to 40 but if you realize that you

missed that payment within about 30 days

of your payment due date the credit card

issuer is likely not going to report

that to the credit bureaus just yet to

hurt your credit score so just make sure

to pay the payment as soon as possible

and you should be fine also if you want

to make sure that missing a credit card

payment never happens so that your

payment history can remain perfect

there's a few things that i like to

recommend that people do first you can

set up automatic payments on your credit

card account so that your statement

balance gets automatically paid on or

before the payment due date each month

now there are two small downsides to

this with number one being that if you

don't have the money linked in your bank

account already then the automatic

payment is either going to get rejected

or you could overdraft on your bank

account and have to pay some fees from

that so if you do set up payments like

this then make sure that you always have

enough cash in your bank account but

downside number two is that automatic

payments could lead you to having less

oversight over your credit card account

which could cause you to either

overspend on your credit cards or it

could cause you to miss charges that

aren't supposed to be there that's why

personally i just like to set reminders

on my phone to check my credit card

accounts on a regular basis a few times

a month that way i make sure that i'm on

top of everything automatic payments can

be a good backup plan but in my opinion

having visibility over your accounts is

also very important so just find a

system that works for you that way you

don't miss any payments and once again

pay off those statement balances on time

and in full each month i know that keeps

saying that but it is something to

always remember now since this video was

really focused on credit cards for

beginners next you'll also want to check

out this video over here on common

credit card mistakes to avoid or this

one over here that i mentioned earlier

about when to pay your credit card bill

but as always thank you so much for

watching i hope you have a great day and

i'll see you in the next one

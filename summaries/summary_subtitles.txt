Hey and welcome to another data structures lesson and today we are going to be going over hash maps. A hash map is a way to map keys to the indexes in the map using whats called a hashing function. There are two important functions when talking about the hash function it are the hash code and the second one is the compression function. A collision is whenever we try to have the same or two different keys into the same index. There are different ways to handle this because you want to think about worst case scenarios. The first one is called separate chaining. The second is called linear probing. The third is called singly linked list. The hash code converts whatever an arbitrary key into an integer value that could be negative or could be larger than the initial array or the hashmap. The compression function means we put it in we make sure its between zero and the size of the array and then there are ways to handle collisions.

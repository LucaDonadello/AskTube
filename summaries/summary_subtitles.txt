If youre a credit card beginner you can easily slip up and make some common mistakes that have some pretty bad consequences. The first lesson that i want to talk about here is easily the top thing that many people skip over even though its so important. The best defense against that unpredictability is by having some sort of a cash safety net to fall back on. The first lesson is to treat your credit card like a debit card. A lot of people view this like theyre using someone elses money with that credit limit but ive never really looked at it like this. ive only looked at my credit card as basically a substitute for my debit card by making sure that ive already got plenty of cash set aside in my bank account. Payment history and credit utilization are the two most important factors affecting your credit score. Credit utilization basically focuses on two things your credit card balance and your credit cards credit limit its calculated as a percentage for each individual credit cards as well as across all cards combined. Payment history is slightly more important for your credit score than credit utilization since payment history makes up about 35 of your fico score. Credit utilization is important because future lenders want to make sure that youre not being too risky and using too much of the credit that youve been given. I like to set reminders on my phone to check my credit card accounts on a regular basis a few times a month that way i make sure that im on top of everything automatic payments can be a good backup plan. Having visibility over your accounts is also very important so just find a system that works for you.
